## Project Overview
ThinkFast AI is an interactive quiz game that provides multiple-choice questions to players. The game is dynamically rendered using DOM manipulation. It keeps track of correct and incorrect answers, providing feedback on the user's performance.

## Features
- Interactive quiz rendered dynamically using JavaScript.
- Correct and incorrect answers are color-coded: green for correct and red for incorrect.
- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure it works across various screen sizes.
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for a clean and organized structure.
- The game is deployed online, so it’s publicly accessible.

## Game Rules
- The game presents a series of multiple-choice questions.
- Players must select an answer from four choices for each question.
- Correct answers will turn **green**, and incorrect answers will turn **red**.
- Players can proceed to the next question using a "Next" button.
- The game ends when all questions have been answered, and the final score is displayed.
