## Project Overview

The Quiz Game is a web-based application that allows users to:
- Select a topic for the quiz.
- Choose a character to represent them during the game.
- Answer AI-generated multiple-choice questions.
- Track their score and progress with a timer and sound effects.

The application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Node.js** for the backend. It integrates with the **OpenAI API** to generate quiz questions dynamically.

## Features

### 1. **Topic Selection**
   - Users can input a topic (e.g., "AI", "History", "Science").
   - The application maps the topic to a category and fetches relevant questions.

### 2. **Character Selection**
   - Users can choose a character (e.g., üê∂, üê±) to represent timer during the quiz.

### 3. **AI-Generated Questions**
   - Questions are generated dynamically using the **OpenAI API**.
   - Each question includes 4 options with one correct answer and 2 options with true or false answers.

### 4. **Timer**
   - A 20-second timer is displayed for each question.
   - If the user doesn't answer in time, the question is marked as incorrect.

### 5. **Sound Effects**
   - Correct answers trigger a "ding" sound.
   - Incorrect answers or timeouts trigger a "wrong" sound.

### 6. **Score Tracking**
   - The user's score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

### 7. **Responsive Design**
   - The application is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## API Integration

The application integrates with the **OpenAI API** to generate quiz questions. The backend (`server.js`) sends a request to the API with the user's selected topic and receives a JSON response containing the question, options, and correct answer.

### Example API Request:
```json
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Generate a multiple-choice question about AI with 4 options and indicate the correct answer."
    }
  ]
}
